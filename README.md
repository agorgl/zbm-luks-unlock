# zbm-luks-unlock

A custom build of [ZFSBootMenu](https://zfsbootmenu.org) to allow unlocking and using zfs pools residing in luks volumes.

## Usage

1. Make sure either podman or docker is installed.

2. Clone the current repository

3.(optionally) Add the partitons' UUIDs to dracut.conf.d/zfsbootmenu-luks-uuids.conf

4. Fetch the latest zbm-builder.sh script from ZFSBootMenu repository

    ```
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zbm-dev/zfsbootmenu/master/zbm-builder.sh
    ```

5. Build a custom ZFSBootMenu image by using current repository as a build directory

    ```
    cd zbm-luks-unlock
    ./zbm-builder.sh -H
    ```

6. The newly built ZFSBootMenu image will reside in the `build` directory

## How it works

The hooks mechanism of ZFSBootMenu is used to inject two hooks into the boot process.

First is the `luks-unlock.sh` early-setup hook that prompts the user for the passphrase that unlocks the luks volumes either 
specified via their UUIDs in dracut.conf.d/zfsbootmenu-luks-uuids.conf or, if this file is empty, then tries to unlock all 
luks partitons that are found.
This allows ZFSBootMenu to discover zfs pools residing in luks volumes. The passphrase is also stored a relevant keyfile
in memory to be used by the later hooks.

Second is the `initramfs-inject.sh` boot-sel hook that with a clever trick, injects the keyfile created by the previous hook
to the initramfs of the selected boot environment. This allows a properly configured system (either using kernel params or
a relevant /etc/crypttab file) to use this keyfile to automatically unlock the luks volumes to be used, without asking
again the user for the passphrase.
