## This early-setup hook has two operating modes. Either it reads the UUIDS from the 
## config file specified in UUID_CONF, or (if empty or not found) finds all LUKS 
## volumes by looking for partitions with fstype "crypto_LUKS". (Partition fstypes 
## can be queried on GPT by supplying lsblk with the "--fs" option; see lsblk(8) for 
## details.)
##
## If LUKS partitions are found, the hook attempts to unlock each encrypted volume.
## If successful, this will allow ZFSBootMenu to automatically find any zfs pools
## residing in these encrypted volumes.
##
## If no LUKS partitions are found, the hook will terminate and allow ZFSBootMenu
## to proceed with its ordinary startup process. A passphrase is asked once and stored
## in memory; this passphrase is subsequently used to unlock all the volumes.
## For each LUKS volume, sanity checks are performed in order to verify that the volume
## is both a valid block device and luks volume and is not already mapped before trying
## to unlock it. After every failed unlock cycle, an emergency shell will be invoked
## to allow manual intervention; type `exit` in the shell to continue the next unlock
## iteration.
##
## The passphrase for each volume is also stored in a keyfile in the ZFSBootMenu
## in-memory filesystem. This allows for special handling by other hooks that may
## try to re-use the passphrase in other parts of the boot process. An example would
## be injecting it to the initramfs of the target boot environment in order to avoid
## asking the user again to unlock a luks volume that has already been unlocked.
##
## Because this script is intended to unlock volumes *before* ZFSBootMenu
## imports ZFS pools, it should be run as an early hook.
